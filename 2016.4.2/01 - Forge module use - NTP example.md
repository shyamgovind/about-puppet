## Using a forge module - An NTP example

This page will give you a first hand example of configuring a NTP service ( as a server or client ) through Puppet. There's a pretty decent quick start guide [here](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/quick_start_ntp.html) from Puppet itself. You may want to look at that first. If it serves your purpose, you need not read any further here. 

_Note_ :
_This doc is for a different audience than the quick start guide. It is for someone who has Puppet installed and has a basic idea on how Puppet works, has seen some basic puppet code. He/she knows what a class, module and resource in puppet is, but doesn't have much experience using it._
