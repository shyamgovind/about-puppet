# 2016.4.2 CHEAT SHEET ( for a monolithic install )

## Most important tasks

### Start/stop services

1. PE master stop/start

  - Stop all PE services :

  ```
  service puppet stop
  service pe-puppetserver stop
  service pe-puppetdb stop
  service pe-console-services stop
  service pe-orchestration-services stop
  service pe-nginx stop
  ```

  - Start all PE services :

  ```
  service puppet start
  service pe-puppetserver start
  service pe-puppetdb start
  service pe-console-services start
  service pe-orchestration-services start
  service pe-nginx start
  ```

2. Puppet agent stop/start

  - Stop agent 
  ```
  service puppet stop
  ```
  - Start agent
  ```
  service puppet start
  ```

### Important files/folders locations for PE :

1. Default folders used by a PE installation :

  ```
  /etc/puppetlabs/      : All configs and puppet code.
  /opt/puppetlabs/      : All binaries/modules for running Puppet itself. ( Not for users )
  /var/log/puppetlabs/  : PE logs folder.
  ```

2. Default puppet code location : 

  ```
  /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/<your env name>/
  
  All modules should go inside this directory, unless you change the defaults.
  ```
  
  - Global manifests location 
  
    You can define global manifests which would be applied to all nodes in the environment. ( unless you put some condition in the manifest itself to apply only to certain nodes of the environment. )
    
    ```
    /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/<your env name>/manifests/
    
    Note : all the files in this directory are "global manifests" and will be executed in alphabetical order. 
    ```


3. Location for external facts :

  Any of these are good -

  ```
  /opt/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/
  /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/
  /etc/facter/facts.d/
  ```

  ( Note : you can even keep them inside any module under a "facts.d" directory. More here : <https://www.puppetcookbook.com/posts/deploying-external-facts-in-modules.html> )

4. License file location :

  ```
  /etc/puppetlabs/license.key
  ```

### Puppet useful commands :

#### Module related

- To generate a module :

  ```
    puppet module generate <author name>-<module name>
  ```

( Note : creates the structure in the current directory )

- List all installed modules :

  ```
  puppet module list
  ```

#### Agent related

- Manually trigger agent runs :

  [On Agent]
  ```
  puppet agent -t ( from the agent )
     OR
  From the console, go to the node and click "Run puppet"
  ```

- Execute agent run in "--noop" mode. (Meaning do not make changes, but tell me what the agent run would do.)

  [On Agent]
  ```
  puppet agent --noop -t
      OR
  From the console, go to the node and click "Run puppet" with the "noop" check box ticked.
  ```

- Get a list of all the classes that are being applied to a node :

  [On Agent]
  ```
  cat `puppet agent --configprint classfile` | grep -Ev "puppet_enterprise|pe_|default|settings" | sort -u
  
  # Explanation : The file path returned by env variable "classfile" contains the list of classes. You can ignore all "puppet_enterprise", "pe_", "default" and "settings" classes, they for the running Puppet itself.

  OR
  
  Go to the console. Click on the node and "Classes" tab.

  ```


#### Master related


- Removing a node from the Puppet setup :

    [On Master]

    ```
    puppet node purge <node name>
    ```

    ( you can find the exact name using command 'puppet cert list --all')

    [On Agent]

    Copy the ./puppet-enterprise-uninstaller onto the agent ( from the PE tarball ) and run the uninstaller as root.



- Run puppet agent run on multiple nodes at a time :

    [On Master]

    ```
    puppet access login --lifetime 1h (generates an access token for 1 hr, for a PE Console user. It asks you the PE console userID/pwd)

    puppet job run --nodes <node names separated by commas and NO spaces> --environment <the environment, nodes belong to>
    ```



#### Modules related

A puppet module is just a collection of files and directories. Ideally, you would write the modules/puppet code on the master and then apply the classes to node groups via the PE Console. There are other ways, of course. Also there is nothing that stops you from keeping puppet code on an agent, but it defeats the purpose of being able to apply the code on all nodes. 

Copying your particular module directory ( with any dependency modules ) _is same as_ installing a module. 


- Installing a module

  To install a module from forge, the module page in forge gives the exact command. But the general command is

  ```
  puppet module install <author_name>-<module>
  ```


- Creating a module

  To generate a module template while creating a new module,

  ```
  puppet module generate <authorname>-<module>
  ```

- Module directory structure

  1. **manifests/** : all the puppet code goes here.
  2. **examples/** : gives examples of how to use the puppet classes in the module.
  3. **files/** : any static files ( usually plain text ) that is going to be used in your module.
  4. **templates/** : all epp or erb templates goes here.
  5. metadata.json : has all the metadata about the module. ( puts the data from your inputs during "puppet module generate" command)


- Testing/applying the puppet code locally

  * Check syntax of the puppet code
    ```
    puppet parser validate <filename>.pp
    
    # No output means everything is syntactically fine.
    ```

  * puppet apply
     
     Once you have written your puppet code in .pp file ( with or without a class ), below _puppet apply_ command would apply the code locally. 
     
     Run a puppet code without class : 
     
     ```
     puppet apply <file_name>.pp  # if the code is written without a class
     ```
     
     Run a puppet code with class definition :
     
     ```
     puppet apply -e "include <your class name>"  # if the code has a class you have to _include_ the class to run it. 
 
     # Note : If your class has parameters then you have pass that as well, unless all have some defaults.
     
     OR
     
     echo "include <your class name>" > test_class.pp       
     puppet apply test_class.pp  # calling a file is more useful when you want to pass parameters to the class while testing.
     ```
     Note : ```--noop``` works with puppet apply too. It'll tell you what the code would do, but won't actually make the changes.
     

### Miscellaneous :

1. Console URL : <https://master_hostname>

2. To get sample template of puppet code or see how a resource would look if expressed in puppet language :

  - puppet resource command

    ```
    puppet resource <resource type> <resource name>
    eg. puppet resource user root
       puppet resource file /etc/hosts
       puppet resource file /etc
       puppet resource service httpd
    ```


3. External facts - debugging

    ```
    puppet facts --debug # gives a detailed output of all that happened during facts gathering.
    ```

4. Puppet forge URL : <https://forge.puppet.com/>

   Order of preference should be Puppet supported, Puppet approved and then the rest.

    - Supported modules link : <https://forge.puppet.com/supported>
    - Approved modules link :<https://forge.puppet.com/approved>

5. Other puppet commands :
   
    * Check puppet version :
      ```
      puppet -V
      ```
      Note : The version is the component "puppet" 's version and not PE version. For PE version, the easiest way is to look at the PE console's bottom-left-most text. It should show something like _v2016.4.2_.

      If you do a ```puppet -V```, you can get the rest of the component versions from here. ( https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/overview_version_table.html )

      ![Puppet version](https://github.com/shyamgovind/puppet-cheat-sheets/blob/master/img/PE_version_2016.4.2.jpg)

    * List all the facts of any node 
      
      [On the node]
      ```
      facter -p  # lists all the facts including external facts.
      
      OR
      
      Go to the node from PE console. Click on Facts tab.
      ```

      To search for a particular fact :
      
      [On the node]
      ```
      facter -p os   # Gives a tree of values inside fact "os".
      facter -p os.release.major # to get value of a fact down the tree.
      ```

    * Sign node certificates when a new node checks in
      
      ```
      PE Console > Nodes > Unsigned Certificates. Accept the ones you want to accept.
      
      OR
      
      On the master,
      puppet cert list # shows the list of unsigned certificates
      puppet cert sign <node name from the list>
        #or puppet cert sign -i --all  # will interactively go through all the certificate requests. 
      
      ```

    * Puppet command help docs
    
      ```
      puppet help   # gives the entire list of all help docs for puppet command and its sub-commands.
      
      # you can then do something like 
        puppet help cert 
      # or
        puppet help node purge
      # etc. to get more details.
      ```
